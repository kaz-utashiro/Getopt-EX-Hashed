# DESCRIPTION

**Getopt::EX::Hashed** is a module to automate a hash object to store
command line option values for **Getopt::Long** and compatible modules
including **Getopt::EX::Long**.  Module name shares **Getopt::EX**
prefix, but it works independently from other modules in
**Getopt::EX**, so far.

Major objective of this module is integrating initialization and
specification into single place.  It also provides simple validation
interface.

Accessor methods are automatically generated when `is` parameter is
given.  If the same function is already defined, the program causes
fatal error.  Accessors are removed when the object is destroyed.
Problems may occur when multiple objects are present at the same time.

# FUNCTION

## **has**

Declare option parameters in a following form.

    has option_name => ( param => value, ... );

For example, to define the option `--number`, which takes an integer
value as a parameter, and also can be used as `-n`, do the following

    has number => spec => "=i n";

The parentheses in the first example are for clarity only and may be
omitted.  The accessor is created with the first name. In this
example, the accessor will be defined as `$app->number`.

If array reference is given, multiple names can be declared at once.

    has [ 'left', 'right' ] => ( spec => "=i" );

If the name start with plus (`+`), given parameter updates existing
setting.

    has '+left' => ( default => 1 );

As for `spec` parameter, label can be omitted if it is the first
parameter.

    has left => "=i", default => 1;

If the number of parameter is not even, default label is assumed to be
exist at the head: `action` if the first parameter is code reference,
`spec` otherwise.

Following parameters are available.

- \[ **spec** => \] _string_

    Give option specification.  `spec =>` label can be omitted if and
    only if it is the first parameter.

    In _string_, option spec and alias names are separated by white
    space, and can show up in any order.

    To have an option called `--start` that takes an integer as its value
    and can also be used with the names `-s` and `--begin`, declare as
    follows.

        has start => "=i s begin";

    Above declaration will be compiled into the next string.

        start|s|begin=i

    which conform to `Getopt::Long` definition.  Of course, you can write
    as this:

        has start => "s|begin=i";

    If the name and aliases contain underscore (`_`), another alias name
    is defined with dash (`-`) in place of underscores.

        has a_to_z => "=s";

    Above declaration will be compiled into the next string.

        a_to_z|a-to-z=s

    If nothing special is necessary, give empty (or white space only)
    string as a value.  Otherwise, it is not considered as an option.

- **alias** => _string_

    Additional alias names can be specified by **alias** parameter too.
    There is no difference with ones in `spec` parameter.

        has start => "=i", alias => "s begin";

- **is** => `ro` | `rw`

    To produce accessor method, `is` parameter is necessary.  Set the
    value `ro` for read-only, `rw` for read-write.

    Read-write accessor has lvalue attribute, so it can be assigned to.
    You can use like this:

        $app->foo //= 1;

    This is much simpler than writing as in the following.

        $app->foo(1) unless defined $app->foo;

    If you want to make accessor for all following members, use
    `configure` to set `DEFAULT` parameter.

        Getopt::EX::Hashed->configure( DEFAULT => [ is => 'rw' ] );

    If you don't like assignable accessor, configure `ACCESSOR_LVALUE`
    parameter to 0.  Because accessor is generated at the time of `new`,
    this value is effective for all members.

- **default** => _value_ | _coderef_

    Set default value.  If no default is given, the member is initialized
    as `undef`.

    If the value is a reference for ARRAY or HASH, new reference with same
    member is assigned.  This means that member data is shared across
    multiple `new` calls.  Please be careful if you call `new` multiple
    times and alter the member data.

    If a code reference is given, it is called at the time of **new** to
    get default value.  This is effective when you want to evaluate the
    value at the time of execution, rather than declaration.  If you want
    to define a default action, use the **action** parameter.

    If a reference to SCALAR is given, the option value is stored in the
    data indicated by the reference, not in the hash object member.  In
    this case, the expected value cannot be obtained by accessing the hash
    member.

- \[ **action** => \] _coderef_

    Parameter `action` takes code reference which is called to process
    the option.  `action =>` label can be omitted if and only if it
    is the first parameter.

    When called, hash object is passed as `$_`.

        has [ qw(left right both) ] => '=i';
        has "+both" => sub {
            $_->{left} = $_->{right} = $_[1];
        };

    You can use this for `"<>"` to catch everything.  In that case,
    spec parameter does not matter and not required.

        has ARGV => default => [];
        has "<>" => sub {
            push @{$_->{ARGV}}, $_[0];
        };

Following parameters are all for data validation.  First `must` is a
generic validator and can implement anything.  Others are shortcut
for common rules.

- **must** => _coderef_ | \[ _coderef_ ... \]

    Parameter `must` takes a code reference to validate option values.
    It takes same arguments as `action` and returns boolean.  With next
    example, option **--answer** takes only 42 as a valid value.

        has answer => '=i',
            must => sub { $_[1] == 42 };

    If multiple code reference is given, all code have to return true.

        has answer => '=i',
            must => [ sub { $_[1] >= 42 }, sub { $_[1] <= 42 } ];

- **min** => _number_
- **max** => _number_

    Set the minimum and maximum limit for the argument.

- **any** => _arrayref_ | qr/_regex_/

    Set the valid string parameter list.  Each item is a string or a regex
    reference.  The argument is valid when it is same as, or match to any
    item of the given list.  If the value is not an arrayref, it is taken
    as a single item list (regexpref usually).

    Following declarations are almost equivalent, except second one is
    case insensitive.

        has question => '=s',
            any => [ 'life', 'universe', 'everything' ];

        has question => '=s',
            any => qr/^(life|universe|everything)$/i;

    If you are using optional argument, don't forget to include default
    value in the list.  Otherwise it causes validation error.

        has question => ':s',
            any => [ 'life', 'universe', 'everything', '' ];

# METHOD

## **new**

Class method to get initialized hash object.

## **optspec**

Return option specification list which can be given to `GetOptions`
function.

    GetOptions($obj->optspec)

`GetOptions` has a capability of storing values in a hash, by giving
the hash reference as a first argument, but it is not necessary.

## **getopt** \[ _arrayref_ \]

Call appropriate function defined in caller's context to process
options.

    $obj->getopt

    $obj->getopt(\@argv);

Above examples are shortcut for following code.

    GetOptions($obj->optspec)

    GetOptionsFromArray(\@argv, $obj->optspec)

## **use\_keys** _keys_

Because hash keys are protected by `Hash::Util::lock_keys`, accessing
non-existent member causes an error.  Use this function to declare new
member key before use.

    $obj->use_keys( qw(foo bar) );

If you want to access arbitrary keys, unlock the object.

    use Hash::Util 'unlock_keys';
    unlock_keys %{$obj};

You can change this behavior by `configure` with `LOCK_KEYS`
parameter.

## **configure** **label** => _value_, ...

Use class method `Getopt::EX::Hashed->configure()` before
creating an object; this information is stored in the area unique for
calling package.  After calling `new()`, package unique configuration
is copied in the object, and it is used for further operation.  Use
`$obj->configure()` to update object unique configuration.

There are following configuration parameters.

- **LOCK\_KEYS** (default: 1)

    Lock hash keys.  This avoids accidental access to non-existent hash
    entry.

- **REPLACE\_UNDERSCORE** (default: 1)

    Produce alias with underscores replaced by dash.

- **REMOVE\_UNDERSCORE** (default: 0)

    Produce alias with underscores removed.

- **GETOPT** (default: 'GetOptions')
- **GETOPT\_FROM\_ARRAY** (default: 'GetOptionsFromArray')

    Set function name called from `getopt` method.

- **ACCESSOR\_PREFIX** (default: '')

    When specified, it is prepended to the member name to make accessor
    method.  If `ACCESSOR_PREFIX` is defined as `opt_`, accessor for
    member `file` will be `opt_file`.

- **ACCESSOR\_LVALUE** (default: 1)

    If true, read-write accessors have lvalue attribute.  Set zero if you
    don't like that behavior.

- **DEFAULT**

    Set default parameters.  At the call for `has`, DEFAULT parameters
    are inserted before argument parameters.  So if both include same
    parameter, later one in argument list has precedence.  Incremental
    call with `+` is not affected.

    Typical use of DEFAULT is `is` to prepare accessor method for all
    following hash entries.  Declare `DEFAULT => []` to reset.

        Getopt::EX::Hashed->configure(DEFAULT => [ is => 'ro' ]);

## **reset**

Reset the class to the original state.
